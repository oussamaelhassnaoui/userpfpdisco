Create a modern, responsive web app that offers a service similar to PFPFinder.com, where users can search, browse, and download high-quality profile pictures and avatars, especially those popular in communities like Discord, anime, gaming, and internet culture; the UI should be sleek, engaging, and visually appealing, with a dark theme option, smooth animations, a search bar with filters (e.g., style, category, trending), and an easy-to-navigate gallery layout that supports previewing and downloading images with minimal clicks.
